<h2>Introduction to Javascript</h2>
<h6>(My Understanding from different reads)</h6>

<h3>Types</h3>

It all starts with Data Types and following are them to start with.

<h5>Declarations:</h5>
<pre>
    var a;          // Declaration
    a = 0;          // a has a value.
    // TYPES
    a = 2;          // Numbers
    a = 0.01;       // Both Integers and Real fall under Numbers
    a = "js";       // String Declarations using Single Quote
    a = 'js';       // String Declarations using Double Quote.
    a = true;       // Boolean
    a = false;      // alternate value of Boolean
    a = null;       // null is a special value which means a null -- will talk more
    a = undefined;  // undefined is similar to null -- will talk more.
</pre>


<h4>Objects & Arrays</h4>

Hmmm.... Objects and Arrays integral part of each and every programming language.


<h4>Expressions & Operators</h4>
