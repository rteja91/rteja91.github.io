<h1 id="the-days-i-relished-seeking-wisdom">The days I relished seeking wisdom.</h1>

<p>This is period between from 2008-2013 at <strong>Indian Institute of Technology, (BHU) Varanasi</strong> where my life transformed from self centered teen to socially matured graduate. The days started to understand and imbibe a new cultural paradigm(Food, Attitude, Sense of living life).</p>



<h2 id="baby-steps-to-start-thinking-differently"><strong>Baby steps to start thinking differently</strong></h2>

<p>Struggling to put things learnt as a language into practical public speaking are the best days with baby steps to start thinking differently towards next days of life.</p>

<p>Yes Language Learnt…! what next…!</p>



<h2 id="adopting-inclusive-nature-and-togetherness">Adopting inclusive nature and togetherness</h2>

<p>The next comes adopting inclusive nature and togetherness. I was very selfish to share whatever I gathered from different sources as it took my energy and time. It does not took much time to understand sharing is caring towards each other. Ultimately, it’s going to circle around give and take policy. </p>



<h2 id="unconditional-giving">Unconditional Giving.</h2>

<p>If you give…You will get it back in some other form. Make sure you go for Unconditional Giving.</p>



<h2 id="handling-responsibility-with-care">Handling Responsibility with care</h2>

<p>When I started climbing steps with small power point talks in class to college and big events. Every experience is unique when you think I am going to do something different this time. A well grown adult emotions is from many experiences which one has gone through. Promotion to handle from one stage show to full event was great responsibility at the age it was taken. It was executed with near flawless ness with all support from Teachers,Seniors, Peers and Juniors. It was all bringing people together for common cause walking with them to reach the final goal which a leader has to envision. </p>



<h2 id="two-exciting-journeys-together">Two exciting journeys together.</h2>

<p>Two paradigms - one with neuroscience and the other with Technology. I carried out two things at once even though they are from two different extremes, where one track was due to inspiration and the other one was due to interest and passion. A challenge is always worth to take when it is Challenging your existence &amp; Survival.</p>



<h3 id="neuro-science">Neuro Science:</h3>

<p>Obviously my first score card in this area showed E which made me think about my existence or am i going to sink with this Grade i got out of struggle for 6 months. I realized that there is something fundamentally wrong which i have done to understand it. I Changed from result oriented strategy to knowledge oriented strategy led to A again in another 5 months. The Challenge which i have taken was inspiring to take it to next level. I was ready to do full length research for rest of my days. I continued it for next 3 years.</p>



<h3 id="technology">Technology:</h3>

<p>I have no idea why i was needing the laptop with only reason that i want to search my regular class notes over internet. Obviously Social networking sites. I was bored with lot of material collected for next 3 years from seniors within 2 months which i don’t know about their usage. It started with simple power point presentations which i practiced between my 10th standard &amp; +1. later Excel Where i started calculating all my lab readings having lot of values with automated formulas. I was hating to calculate same final formula using Scientific calculator, I am not sure now those excel sheets which i have prepared were used for next 3 generations. I still have them. Later i moved towards correcting a website as one of my friend said it will take time to update content. I took ftp details from him i started editing the content carefully. I started learning html and inline styling.</p>

<p>More experiments with technology will shared on this blog. </p>



<h3 id="meeting-point">Meeting point.</h3>

<p>I knew little neuroscience and small piece of html which is not at all big stuff. After lot of study i came to know they both meet a point called <strong>Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning</strong>. I always started but never finished a Machine Learning Course till date [jan 15 2017].</p>



<h2 id="living-dreams-of-abroad-constraints">Living Dreams of Abroad &amp; Constraints</h2>

<p>While i was working with neuroscience and little bit understanding on Technology. After lot of research and analysis, best place for me was US or European universities to continue my study of interest.</p>

<p>Family needs and financial constraints made me think to step back from it. I am confident that i can go and work in my study of interest in some more days.</p>

<h2 id="graduating-in-political-play-arena">Graduating in Political play Arena</h2>

<p>What is challenging in the Top Tier institutes is to handle Competition which is political in nature. It takes time to understand this situations happening around and respond to it. We should never react to these situations. Just wait for the time and respond to it.</p>

<p>I am glad that i had many such experiences while i was in the process of Graduating. I took some stones at me initially but later instances were handled with a lot maturity. </p>

<p>I always loved to play here and this is favorite brain sport through out my graduating time.</p>

<h2 id="entrepreneur-ideology">Entrepreneur Ideology</h2>

<p>It is buzz word.. But for me it’s a way of life. Finding the problems and solving them is an entrepreneur’s Nature. The instances of automating things which i do using tech even writing a small formula in excel and finding ways to do things differently. Presenting stuff in innovative ways. Making people think on what i say and most of the times making them act upon it has been part of my life.</p>

<p>Had a B-Plan presented won as second best and One of the Judge has super liked the idea and jumped in for helping to implement a pilot. but it was not succeeded as i was not showing much interest because of my project &amp; Exams &amp; Job seeking pressure in final year.</p>

<h2 id="job-vs-entrepreneur-path">Job vs Entrepreneur Path</h2>

<p>Finally at mid of final Year i was placed in an MNC in the campus. the package it has offered was low. but i was stuck in dilemma of testing myself as an entrepreneur or to go for regular Job. </p>

<p>In the meanwhile i have started working on my Plan of making website which will promote services which i thought of making is an easy. Finished my graduation and i was sitting home with many plans awaiting for joining from MNC. </p>

<p>There came a call from 2 startups from known network. As i already had a startup bug in my head. just carefully chosen path to understand how entrepreneurship works without burning our hands and let watch how people burn hands or grow the companies. </p>

<p>Here is where i took a path to a lean startup and leaving the MNC offer behind.</p>
