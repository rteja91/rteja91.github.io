<h1>Lexical Structure of Javascript</h1>

<h4>Optional Semicolons</h4>

There are two exceptions to the general rule that JavaScript interprets line breaks as
semicolons when it cannot parse the second line as a continuation of the statement on
the first line.

The first exception involves the return, break, and continue statements
﻿The second exception involves the ++ and −− operators
